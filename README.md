# Beer_Project

The struggle to find the perfect beer for your tastes is real.  The large retailers have an overwhelming selection of beers and finding one
with your preferences is time consuming and often frustrating.  This app will give an immediate listing of beers that fall within your 
preferences and even recommend food pairings to give you the perfect evening.

Decision Tree machine learning was used in a Jupyter Notebook, while Flask/Heroku, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used for the user
interface.  Just check the box for your preferred alcohol content, bitterness, mouthfeel, and color and the app will give return your
best beer options.

Just click a few times and your evening will be planned for you.
